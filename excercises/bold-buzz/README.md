# BoldBuzz

BoldBuzz is a small application that returns the string value of a given number. When the given number can be divided by 3, BoldBuzz should return "Bold". If the number can be divided by 5, BoldBuzz should return "Buzz". When the number can be both divided by 3 and 5, it should return "BoldBuzz".

## Prerequisites

## Goal
Create the applciation in a Test Driven Way. Remeber, first write a failing test, then only write the necessary code to make the tests pass. When all tests pass, you can refactor your code.

Run the test by executing following command in the exercise folder:
```
npm test
```
